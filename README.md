# Preprocessing Data for Data Science Salary Analysis 💰

## Introduction
This project focuses on preprocessing data for analyzing salaries in the data science field. The goal is to prepare a clean, structured dataset that can be used for various data analysis and machine learning tasks to understand salary trends.

## Data Collection
Data Collection
Data collection is the first step in any data analysis project. For this analysis, I used data from Kaggle. The dataset includes the following features:

work_year: The year the salary was recorded.
experience_level: The level of experience of the employee.
job_title: The job title of the employee.
salary: The salary amount.
salary_currency: The currency of the salary.
salary_in_usd: The salary converted to USD.
employee_residence: The location of the employee's residence.
remote_ratio: The percentage of remote work.
company_location: The location of the company.
company_size: The size of the company.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involves removing or correcting inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the data. This step is crucial to ensure the quality of the analysis.

## Data Transformation
Data transformation involves converting data into a suitable format for analysis.

## Conclusion 
In summary, this project focuses on data preprocessing before training the model. By cleaning, transforming data, feature engineering, handling missing values, normalization, and data splitting, I aim to ensure the integrity and quality of the dataset. I hope this article will be helpful for your data science projects.
